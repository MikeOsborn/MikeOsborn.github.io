          <p>We currently convert existing bicycles to hybrid versions complete with a battery, motor, controller, and display. We also sell completed e-bikes by Best E-Bikes USA based in Colorado. We do this operating out of a Ford transit van. We will travel up to 100 miles from Aberdeen.  We will come to your location and convert your bike in about two hours.  If the conversion takes longer than two hours the labor is free.
